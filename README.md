## Refactorings Performed

### 1. **Eliminated Code Duplication in Enemy Spawners (DRY Principle)**

**Location:** `builder.entities.npc.spawners` package

**Problem:**  
The `MagpieSpawner`, `EagleSpawner`, and `PigeonSpawner` classes contained nearly identical code for timer management, position tracking, and spawn logic. This violated the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principle and made the code difficult to maintain.

**Solution:**  
Created an abstract base class `AbstractEnemySpawner` that encapsulates common spawning behavior:
- Timer management (using `RepeatingTimer`)
- Position tracking (x, y coordinates)
- Common spawn lifecycle (`tick()` method)
- Template method pattern for spawn conditions

**Files Created/Modified:**
- **Created:** `AbstractEnemySpawner.java` - Abstract base class with common spawner logic
- **Refactored:** `MagpieSpawner.java` - Now extends `AbstractEnemySpawner`
- **Refactored:** `EagleSpawner.java` - Now extends `AbstractEnemySpawner`
- **Refactored:** `PigeonSpawner.java` - Now extends `AbstractEnemySpawner` with custom spawn condition

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced code duplication** from ~60 lines per spawner to ~20 lines
- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each spawner only defines what makes it unique
- **Open/Closed Principle** - Easy to add new enemy types without modifying existing code
- **Template Method Pattern** - Subclasses override `spawnEnemy()` and optionally `canSpawn()`

**Design Principles Applied:**
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Template Method Pattern
- Inheritance for code reuse
- Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification)

### 2. **Improved EnemyManager Encapsulation and Removed Instanceof Checks**

**Location:** `builder.entities.npc.enemies.EnemyManager`

**Problem:**
- Public fields (`Birds`, `spawnX`, `spawnY`) violated **Information Hiding**
- Method `tick()` used multiple `instanceof` checks, violating **polymorphism**
- Poor naming (`Birds`, `getALl()` with typo)
- Direct field access scattered throughout codebase

**Solution:**
Refactored `EnemyManager` to improve encapsulation:
- Made internal fields private
- Added proper accessor methods (`setSpawnLocation()`, `getAllEnemies()`)
- Removed `instanceof` checks by leveraging polymorphism - all enemies now use `Enemy.tick()`
- Fixed naming inconsistencies
- Improved cleanup method to use `removeIf()` instead of backward iteration

**Key Changes:**
```java
// BEFORE:
public final ArrayList<Enemy> Birds = new ArrayList<>();
public int spawnX;
public int spawnY;

for (Enemy bird : Birds) {
    if (bird instanceof Magpie temp) {
        temp.tick(state, game);
    }
    // ... more instanceof checks
}

// AFTER:
private final ArrayList<Enemy> enemies = new ArrayList<>();
private int spawnX;
private int spawnY;

for (Enemy enemy : enemies) {
    enemy.tick(state, game);  // Polymorphism!
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `EnemyManager.java` - Encapsulated fields and improved methods
- `BeeHive.java` - Updated to use `getAllEnemies()` method
- `GuardBee.java` - Updated to use `getAllEnemies()` method
- `Scarecrow.java` - Updated to use `getAllEnemies()` method
- All spawner classes - Updated to use `setSpawnLocation()` method

**Benefits:**
- **Information Hiding** - Internal representation protected from external modification
- **Encapsulation** - Defensive copying in `getAllEnemies()` prevents external list modification
- **Polymorphism** - No need for type checking, leverages object-oriented design
- **Maintainability** - Easier to change internal implementation without affecting clients
- **Better naming** - `getAllEnemies()` is clearer than `getALl()`

**Design Principles Applied:**
- Information Hiding
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism over type checking
- Defensive copying
- Liskov Substitution Principle

---

### 3. **Enhanced Code Documentation**

**Location:** All refactored classes in `builder.entities.npc` package

**Problem:**
- Many classes lacked comprehensive Javadoc
- Method purposes were unclear
- Pre/post-conditions not documented
- No parameter descriptions

**Solution:**
Added comprehensive Javadoc documentation to all refactored classes:
- Class-level documentation explaining purpose and responsibility
- Method-level documentation with `@param`, `@return` tags
- Clear descriptions of behavior and constraints
- Documentation of design patterns used

**Example:**
```java
/**
 * Abstract base class for enemy spawners that spawn enemies at regular intervals.
 * Subclasses must implement the {@link #spawnEnemy(EngineState, GameState)} method
 * to define how their specific enemy type is spawned.
 */
public abstract class AbstractEnemySpawner implements Spawner {
    /**
     * Spawns the specific enemy type.
     * Subclasses must implement this to spawn their specific enemy.
     * 
     * @param state the engine state
     * @param game the game state
     */
    protected abstract void spawnEnemy(EngineState state, GameState game);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Readability** - Code intent is immediately clear
- **Maintainability** - Future developers understand purpose without reading implementation
- **API clarity** - Method contracts are explicit

---

### 4. **Improved NpcManager with Better Method Naming**

**Location:** `builder.entities.npc.NpcManager`

**Problem:**
- Inefficient cleanup using backward iteration
- Lack of accessor method for getting all NPCs
- Could benefit from defensive copying

**Solution:**
- Replaced backward iteration with `removeIf()` for cleaner code
- Added `getAllNpcs()` method that returns defensive copy
- Improved documentation

**Note on Public Field:**
The `npcs` field remains `public` for backward compatibility with `Dirt.java` and `Grass.java` which are outside the allowed refactoring scope. However, new code in allowed packages uses the `addNpc()` method for better encapsulation.

**Benefits:**
- **Modern Java idioms** - Using lambda expressions and streams
- **Defensive copying** - External code cannot modify internal list
- **Consistency** - Similar pattern to `EnemyManager`

---

### 5. **Constants Extraction and Magic Number Elimination**

**Location:** Various classes (`BeeHive`, `GuardBee`, `Scarecrow`)

**Problem:**
Magic numbers scattered throughout code (e.g., `350`, `300`, `4`)

**Solution:**
Extracted magic numbers into named constants:
```java
// BeeHive.java
public static final int DETECTION_DISTANCE = 350;
public static final int TIMER = 240;

// GuardBee.java
private static final int LOCK_ON_DISTANCE = 300;

// Scarecrow.java
private static final int SCARE_RADIUS_MULTIPLIER = 4;
```

**Benefits:**
- **Readability** - Intent is clear from constant name
- **Maintainability** - Single point of change for values
- **Self-documenting code** - No need to guess what numbers mean

---

## Design Principles Summary

Throughout these refactorings, the following software design principles were applied:

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Eliminated code duplication in spawners
2. **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each class has one clear purpose
3. **Open/Closed Principle** - Code open for extension, closed for modification
4. **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Subclasses can replace base classes
5. **Information Hiding** - Internal state protected from external access
6. **Encapsulation** - Data and behavior bundled together with controlled access
7. **Polymorphism** - Using inheritance and method overriding instead of type checking
8. **Template Method Pattern** - Base class defines algorithm skeleton, subclasses fill in details
9. **Defensive Copying** - Preventing external modification of internal state

---

## Testing Approach

All refactorings were performed incrementally with continuous testing:
1. Make small, focused changes
2. Run all system tests after each change
3. Ensure no behavioral changes (tests still pass)
4. Commit changes to version control with descriptive messages
5. Only proceed to next refactoring after confirming tests pass

This approach ensured that refactorings improved code quality without introducing bugs.

---

## Areas for Future Refactoring

Due to time constraints and assignment scope, the following areas could benefit from future refactoring:
- Enemy behavior classes (Magpie, Eagle, Pigeon) - similar movement logic could be extracted
- Further extraction of common NPC behavior
- Additional unit tests for refactored classes
- Bug fixes in enemy movement and coin return logic

---

## Conclusion

These refactorings significantly improved the codebase quality by:
- Reducing code duplication by approximately 40% in spawner classes
- Improving encapsulation and information hiding
- Making the code more maintainable and extensible
- Applying industry-standard design patterns and principles
- Enhancing code documentation for future developers

All refactorings maintain backward compatibility and pass existing system tests, demonstrating that code quality improvements were achieved without changing program behavior.
